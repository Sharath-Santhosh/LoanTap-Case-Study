# LoanTap-Case-Study

(Logistic Regression)

LoanTap, an online platform offering customized loan products, aims to enhance its underwriting process for Personal Loans. The goal is to develop a data-driven model to assess the creditworthiness of individuals applying for a Personal Loan.

Given a set of applicant attributes, the objective is to determine whether a credit line should be extended. Additionally, the model should provide business recommendations on appropriate repayment terms to ensure responsible lending and minimize risk.

This analysis will support LoanTap in making informed lending decisions, optimizing customer satisfaction, and maintaining a sustainable loan portfolio.
